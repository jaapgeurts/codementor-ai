# The importantance for students to learn variables.

## It's impossible to write a program without variables.

- Can't program without variables  
- Without variables you can't program.  
- It is impossible to program without variables.   
- Impossible to program without variables

## Variables represent data or state which a program operates on.

- Actions are connected to or operate on data.  
- To be able to perform data manipulation   
- To be able to remember information from past actions and to use that information in future actions.   
- To learn/understand that information is stored in memory in order to apply operations on them.   
- Variables are necessary because to write a program or algorithm variables are required to remember data and state for later use.     
- Remembering context and state.  


## Variables are a basic element and essential component of a program.

- To structure data.  
- Because naming is related to documentation   
- Naming improves readability, maintainability and quality   
- So they are able to choose the correct/appropriate datatype
- To learn a how to apply a certain abstraction in the student's algorithms of a program.  
- Build logic thinking skills
